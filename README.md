## Description

  > This repository presents an frontend app with login and subscription system for a company to handle products and clients

## How To Use

* First you must run this app using the following command

```bash
  npm run start
```

* After this, the app will open in your browser, and you will be able to login.

* After log-in, you will be able to see your products and clients, and add more of them.

* If you click on any item os products/clients list, this item will open a form, where you can see all its infos, edit or delete it.

### Observations

* Everything here is saved on LocalStorage, so, the level of security is almost unexistent.

* All of the loading time is fake, just to simulate the experience of accessing a db, or hitting an API.

* There is a block to access pages without been logged.

* I hope you enjoy this code!
